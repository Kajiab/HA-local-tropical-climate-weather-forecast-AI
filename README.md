# HA-local-tropical-climate-weather-forecast-AI
Tropical climate weather forecast for home assistant. Using Temperature, Humidity, Pressure and Dewpoint for forecasting

Due to Zambretti can not use with tropical climate, weather are more micro change, so I try to forecast weather from
others parameters which more sensitive on weather change.

And after reaserch, I can apply AI to learn pattern of theses parameters for alerting coming rain for next 1-3 hr.
Thank for
